# src/pipelines/analytics/benchmark/materialize.py
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Turns a benchmark's definition versions + fact_prices into facts.
# One run, three outputs (docs/PENDING_PIPELINES.md item 5):
#   1. dated holdings into fact_positions_model, tagged with the
#      version_id that produced them;
#   2. a fact_portfolio_valuation row per date (the weight denominator
#      vw_positions_unified divides by);
#   3. the level series into fact_prices on the index entity,
#      source 'model'.
# Everything in one transaction: a failed run leaves the stored
# series untouched.
#
# Semantics:
#   - Levels are base 100 at the first version's effective_from and
#     chained across versions: a new version re-strikes its holdings
#     at the level the old one reached, so the index is continuous.
#   - buy_and_hold: weights are the allocation AT effective_from only;
#     afterwards each holding floats with its price (weights drift).
#   - fixed_weights: the same allocation is re-struck at every
#     rebalance boundary (monthly | quarterly | annual) until the next
#     version takes over.
#   - heuristic: a named rule without a module yet; refused.
#   - The notional is explicit and unitless: valor_cartera = level,
#     valor_cuota = level (one quota outstanding), so
#     SUM(market_value_pen) per date = level and weights sum to 1.
#   - Holdings on a date are END-OF-DAY: on a handover date they are
#     the new basket's, struck at that day's level, which is what the
#     next day's attribution needs. The level on the handover date is
#     the old basket's mark-to-market (the two agree by construction).
#
# The chaining arithmetic is PURE (chain(), chain_levels()) over plain
# dicts, so it is tested without a database. The database half reads
# the governing versions (definitions.governing_versions), their
# constituents' prices, folds in the FX leg and writes the three
# outputs row by row.
#
# Rows are never deleted. fact_positions_model keys on version_id, so
# a restatement writes new rows and the old version's stay (the
# current view picks the highest version_id per date). The level and
# the valuation rows have no version in their key: they are the
# current restatement, upserted in place. If a rebuild covers FEWER
# dates than the stored series (a later first effective_from), the
# stale levels are left alone and counted in the summary.
